## Introduction
This repository documents the process of creating an ART (Computed Tomography) image dataset and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) on it. The goal is to extract various features from the CT images and analyze the correlation between these features and the dependent variable, which could be related to a medical condition or research interest.

## Dataset
### Data Collection
- Describe where and how the CT images were collected.
- Explain the dataset's scope, size, and diversity.

### Data Preprocessing
- Address any issues such as duplicates, missing values, and standardizing image formats.

### Labeling
- Explain how images were labeled, especially if the dataset involves multiple conditions or outcomes.

## Exploratory Data Analysis
- The exploratory data analysis techniques used, including data summary, visualization, correlation analysis, and PCA.
- Include code snippets or images of plots if applicable.

## Machine Learning and Statistical Analysis
- Explain how machine learning models were trained to predict the dependent variable using the extracted features.
- Discuss feature importance determination and hypothesis testing techniques employed.

## Interpretation and Reporting
- Summarize the findings and conclusions from your analysis.
- Include visual aids such as graphs and tables to support your results.
- Consider ethical considerations, data privacy, and any limitations in your study.
